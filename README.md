# NumberGuessing



This is a very basic and simple game written in Java. The goal of the game is to guess a random generated number between (currently) 1 and 200.
If you guess the number correctly a gui is going to pop up. I hope youÂ´ll enjoy it.


Note: It took ages to figure out how to display text on a fucking GUI.
